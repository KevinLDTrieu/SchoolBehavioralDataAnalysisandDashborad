<h1> School Behavioral Data Analysis </h1>

<h2> Description </h2>
Behavioral data is taken during the 2022-2023 school year from August to March in New York City. If a student needs to be reported for behavior issues, a referral is written and the information is recorded which made our data set. The data was then analyzed to find trends and vizuals were made below.  
<br />

<h2> Utilities Used </h2>
- <b> Google Sheets </b> 

<h2> Environments Used </h2>
- <b> Windows 11 </b> (22H2)

<h2> Cleaning </h2>
The data set was cleaned using concatenate, split, and text. The following columns were kept to utialize in analysis: Date, Time Referral Sent In	, Day of the Week	, Class, Student Home Room, IEP if Applicable	, and Reason for Referral. Separate tables were made for analysis as well. 

<h2> Analysis </h2>

It was found that students received the most referrals at the beginning of the year and as students get used to being in school, the number of behaviors decreased. Note that the months with more days off school also had a lower number of referrals which could indicate that more days off can lead to less behavior issues.

The bar graph above is to supplement the findings from the line chart. This data seems to support the natural trend of behavior throughout each school year as confirmed by the Dean of Culture (subject matter expert) at this school.

The pie chart indicates that the most common behavior is repeated disruptions at 34.6% and then repeated failure to follow instructions at 21.4%. Note that if students are given a referral for multiple items, they are all counted in this calculation. The data indicates that student relationships with adults are not as strong which could cause students to have these types of behaviors.

The above pie chart indicates that student referrals are highest on Wednesday (27%) and Thursday (25.5%) which indicates that students become disengaged in the middle of the week and start to misbehave.

This bar graph splits the data based on day of the week. Wednesday and Thursday had the most disruptions. Tuesday and Thursday had a high number of refusal to follow directions. Disruptions were the highest behavior on Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday while refusal of directions was the highest on Tuesday.

The bar graph indicated above shows that ELA, Math, recess, lunch, and transitions have the most referrals. Students are not used to less unstructured time when they see their friends during lunch, recess, and during transitions. ELA and math are also double blocks which means students may need breaks during these periods to reengage properly in learning materials.

7th grade has the most referrals likely due to the developmental age and its characteristics. The data also shows that 6th grade has a high number and similar number for repeated disruptions and failure to follow directions. The data between 6th and 7th grade were very similar in terms of inappropriate language and inappropriate physical contact.

The graphs on the last page indicate that there are about 40% referrals for female students and 60% referrals from male students which is about the same as the population split for the school. This means the number of referrals students get is not based on their gender. It is noted however that male students typically have more inappropriate physical contact based on the bar chart.

This chart indicates the number of referrals for students with and without IEPs. Students with IEPs make up about 38% of all referrals compared to 62% for general education students.

Above is the percentage of students with behaviors split by students with IEPs and without IEPs. The graphs and numbers are very similar which indicate that the type of referral is not dependent on if students have IEPs or not. 

<h3> Dashboards </h3>
After analysis and data meetings, it was found that behavioral data needed to be tracked in real time for the next school year. I created a dashboard that updates for each month of the school year as data is collected. Be we used sample data to see userablility.
